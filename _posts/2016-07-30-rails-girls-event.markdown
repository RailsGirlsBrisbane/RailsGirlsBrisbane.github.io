## Rails Girls Brisbane July 2016

Rails Girls 2016 has ended and wow what a weekend it was. We had fantastic sponsors, mentors, food, coffee, venue and possibly most of all amazing participants.

As always we built and deployed a web app as part of the Rails Girls Beginners track. This year we also ran a Rails Girls Next track which focused on exposing the magic of rails. To demonstrate this we built a sinatra app from the ground up!

We had many presentations and talks all focused on the theme of demystifying Rails magic and we updated our user guides, making them even more user friendly than the previous ones.

Feeback so far has been really positive.

Thanks again for coming and we hope to see you all again soon :)
