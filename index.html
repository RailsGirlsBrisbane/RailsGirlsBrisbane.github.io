<h2>MVC - Model</h2>
    <p>
        We keep hearing MVC referred to when talking about Rails. But what does it really mean? Over the next three weeks we'll cover each component in detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        The M in MVC stands for model.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every web application that has anything other than very basic functionality will have a database behind it. And every object in our application will be represented by a table in that database.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, for example, in a shopping website we will need to store information about our products and the customers who buy those products. Each time a Customer buys a Product it will generate a Transaction. This Transaction will also need to be stored in the database. So our database will have (at least) three tables: customers, products and transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        A model is that part of your Rails application whose job it is to talk to the underlying database. So, in our Rails application above, we will need to have three models: Customer, Product and Transaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we need to obtain data about any of these three objects, we will ask the relevant model. That model will in turn ask the database.
    </p>

<h3>About us</h3>

<p>Hi and welcome to the Rails Girls BNE blog</p>

<p>Rails Girls is an international community dedicated to introducing women to software development in a safe and inclusive environment. We run a workshop in Brisbane biannually.
It takes place over two days - Friday evening and a full day workshop on Saturday. We have mentors from the Rails community, as well as other people interested in supporting the event who bring a range of skills.
We have recently added a second track (Rails Girls Next) for the not so beginners attendees.</p>

<p>Some of our attendees go on to pursue programming full time - they've also come back to mentor others which perpetuates the inclusive nature of the event and the growth of the community.
It's an amazing community that fosters learning and empowers the attendees.</p>

<p>We have had six Rails Girls events in Brisbane since June 2013, and we're keen to keep them going.</p>

<p>Our blog has been developed to complement the learnings at the Rails Girls workshops. We currently focus on Ruby tips, Rails stuff, Sinatra, and everything in-between.
We want lots of comments and feedback so we can continue to blog about things you want to hear about.</p>
