<h2>RESTful Constraints Sept 2016</h2>
<p>REST (representational state transfer) is a big topic so we won't attempt to cover it all in this post. Firstly, it's
    a very important topic
    and secondly, we don't want to bore you with too much info. That's just not the Rails Girls style! :) </p>

<p>This post will focus on the constraints of REST. We will cover the top four constraints.</p>

<h3>1st Constraint</h3>

<p><strong>Client / Server:</strong> We need to follow the client/server architecture. The purpose of the client is to make the request
    and the server to respond to it. Straightforward enough!</p>

<h3>2nd Constraint</h3>
<p><strong>Stateless:</strong> This means that the full interaction should be enclosed in the request and response exchange. For example,
    we 'request' a resource from the server and the response returns all the requested information in a single
    interaction. Not too tricky either!</p>

<h3>3rd Constraint</h3>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> For any resource in our app, we should be able to access this resource via a stable url. For example, to
    get the <strong>Idea</strong> resource in our Rails Girls app, we used the url `www.example.com/ideas`. If we had a
    different app with a <strong>Product</strong> resource, we would use the url www.example.com/products.</p>

<p>To comply with this constraint in a Rails app, simply define your resources in your <strong>routes.rb</strong> file
    by using either <strong>resource</strong> or <strong>resources</strong>. This will automatically give you all the
    standard RESTful routes with their corresponding standard urls.

<h3>4th Constraint</h3>
<p><strong>Manipulation through representations:</strong> The manipulation part of this constraint refers to the HTTP verbs included in
    the request (GET, PUT, POST and DELETE). The representations parts refers to the different formats your rails app
    might respond with (eg. JSON, XML or HTML). We have a useful helper that we can use in our controllers for different
    responses:

    {% highlight sh %}
    respond_to do |format|
    ..different formats
    end
    {% endhighlight %}

<p>The important point to note is that, regardless of the response format, the url stays the same. That's pretty
    impressive!</p>

<p>And that is our first high-level introduction to REST. We have more to cover over the coming weeks so stay tuned! To
    read more to get a better understanding we encourage you to

<h3>About us</h3>

<p>Hi and welcome to the Rails Girls BNE blog</p>

<p>Rails Girls is an international community dedicated to introducing women to software development in a safe and inclusive environment. We run a workshop in Brisbane biannually.
It takes place over two days - Friday evening and a full day workshop on Saturday. We have mentors from the Rails community, as well as other people interested in supporting the event who bring a range of skills.
We have recently added a second track (Rails Girls Next) for the not so beginners attendees.</p>

<p>Some of our attendees go on to pursue programming full time - they've also come back to mentor others which perpetuates the inclusive nature of the event and the growth of the community.
It's an amazing community that fosters learning and empowers the attendees.</p>

<p>We have had six Rails Girls events in Brisbane since June 2013, and we're keen to keep them going.</p>

<p>Our blog has been developed to complement the learnings at the Rails Girls workshops. We currently focus on Ruby tips, Rails stuff, Sinatra, and everything in-between.
We want lots of comments and feedback so we can continue to blog about things you want to hear about.</p>
