<h2>Rails Migrations</h2>

<p>This week I came across an issue with a database migration that could easily have been avoided.</p>

<p>I was querying a database that contained a number of boolean NULL values. This is ambiguous, as it could mean false or it could simply mean that the value has never been set.</p>

<p>This scenario is easily avoided by simply setting your boolean to either true or false as a part of your migration. For example;</p>

<p><code>add_column :staff, :is_admin, :boolean, null: false, default: false</code></p>

<p>That&#39;s it! Easy right? It may not change your life but it will surely avoid a headache somewhere down the track.</p>
